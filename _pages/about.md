##### Hello!
I'm just a dude figuring out and learning Jekyll as well as Ruby, and what better way to learn than to use it? I've looked a lot at the original template for this project, by Maxime Vaillancourt, as well as meewgumi's template. I wanted the styling options from Meewgumi's version, but with the upstream fixes from the original version, so I created my own version banking on both, and also fixed some bugs while I was at it.

## Why?
I wanted to create a website with lore for my dnd club, and this was the best solution I could find! I love using Obsidian, and I really like the publishing workflow of github and netlify
