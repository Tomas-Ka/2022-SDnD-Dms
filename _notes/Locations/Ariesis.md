Title: Ariesis
---
### Description:
A great fortress of a city, the [[Tritons|Triton]] capital Ariesis is built primarily out of marble and prismarine, with a magical shield protecting the top of the city. Even inside the city there is water everywhere, and visitors are given a magical breathing device that functions on the same city wide power that powers the magical shield.

### History:
Before [[The Great Flood]] Ariesis was a lot smaller than it is at the moment, but during the [[Tritons|Tritons']] great expansion of land, and the following explosion in population, the city was quickly expanded and built into a giant and beautifull fortress of a city. When the [[Sahuagin]] and the rest of the monsters suddenly came and attacked in great numbers, all the race's cities fell, except for Ariesis, which is now the last bastion for the [[Tritons]].
