Title: Telan
---
### Description:
Telan is a grizzled old man with short green hair. He wouldn't be caught dead without his army uniform, and the countless medals of honour decorating it.

### About:
Telan has commanded the [[Tritons|Triton]] army for many many years, and is a very talented and highly respectable commander. No matter how good the commander, impossible odds are still just that, and the fact that he's managed to protect [[Ariesis]] so far is nothing short of a miracle.
