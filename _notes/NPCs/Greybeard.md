Title: Greybeard
---
### Description:
A stout old dwarf with a grey beard that reaches almost all the way down to his feet.

### About:
The elected leader of the [[Dwarves]]. He is one of the oldest, but also one of the greediest, and does not like parting with his money for any reason. With that said, he always stays true to his word, and the dwarvish code of honour.
