Title: Astrid
---
### Description:
A rough and stout looking woman, clad in halfplate, and always carrying a longsword.

### About:
Strict but fair, Astrid is a brave but wise adventurer, with years of experience to prove it. When she heard of a mysterious land sinking into the ocean at an unprecedented space, she wasted no time in getting together a crew, and sending the message out to her contacts. Within only a year, she had managed to source and secure enough materials, ships and people to attempt the voyage, and once she arrived she set up the floating city of [[Camp Tranquil]], and is currently running the adventurer's guild there.
