A lanky [[Tritons|Triton]] with elaborate earrings in the shape of fish and long flowing dark blue hair.

Keros is quite a young Noble, who has experienced the great rise and subsequent fall of his race. He is desperate to find a solution for their [[Sahuagin]]. Though he has heard about [[Camp Tranquil]] and the adventurers' guild there he hasn't been able to send a messenger, or a message of any kind due to all the monsters patrolling right outside the city gates.
