### Description:
The adventurers' conglomeration is a large collection of ships that have recently traveled to 造NAME造 and set up a floating city, consisting of boats all bound together into a large sprawnling platform. There are all sorts of people here, adventurers first and foremost, but also other travelers; wayfarers and a few very brave merchants.

### History:
Created just a few months back, the adventurers' conglomeration begun as a collection of four ships that travelled to [[造NAME造]] together. They soon realized that travling alone was dangerous, and the local people have enough problems themselves to look after ships full of strangers

### Important people here:
* [[Adventurer's guild leader]], the leader of the adventurers guild, and also the driving force behind the conglomeration
