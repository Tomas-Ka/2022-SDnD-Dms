Title: Tritons
---
### History:
Before [[The Great Flood]] the Tritons lived in the giant lake that existed in the middle of the continent, and they had full reign over matters both on and under the sea. [[The Great Flood]], whilst horrible for every other race, was first a great boon to the Tritons. They gained much space to expand their people, and build quite a few cities at the bottom of the sea. As time went on however, more and more [[Sahuagin]] began appearing, driving back the Tritons in a long, bloody conflict, and now only a single Triton city remains, [[Ariesis]].

### Info:
survival
The Tritons don't have time to worry about anybody but themselves, and to not let their last city [[Ariesis]] fall. Military


### Problem:
Ever increasing attacks from [[Sahuagin]] and other sea monsters that become more ruthless every time are stopping the Tritons from doing anything but prepare for and fight a long, bloody war.

* [[Telan]] the Military leader of the Tritons
* [[Keros]] Triton noble concerned with the fate of the people
